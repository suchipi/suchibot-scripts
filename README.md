# suchibot-scripts

a bunch of random mouse/keyboard macro/automation scripts written using [suchibot](https://github.com/suchipi/suchibot).

some of them are silly, some are utilities I use in games, some are just fun.

## Usage

### First-time setup

- install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- clone the repo and open a terminal to the folder you cloned it into
- run `npm install`

### Each use after

- open a terminal to the folder you cloned it into
- run `npx suchibot whatever-script-you-want-to-run.ts`, using a different filename for `whatever-script-you-want-to-run.ts`, eg. `npx suchibot spam-mouse.ts`
